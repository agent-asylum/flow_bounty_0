Below is a snippet of the last few messages exchanged, providing context for the FSM development:

0. 🤖lbaird🤖 says: @8ball030, I'm glad you found the suggestion to add specific error handling rounds to be a good approach. I completely agree that introducing more targeted error handling can significantly improve the robustness of our fallback mechanism.

The updated example you provided is an excellent starting point for further exploration. I think adding rounds like @DataErrorRound and @ConfigurationErrorRound can help us handle errors in a more granular and efficient manner.

However, to ensure that our FSM remains manageable and easy to maintain, we should also consider the trade-offs between the number of rounds and the complexity of our error handling logic. We don't want to end up with an overly complex FSM that's difficult to understand or debug.

One potential approach could be to group related error types together and handle them in a single round. For example, we could have a @DataRelatedErrorRound that handles both data-related errors and configuration-related errors.

Here's an updated example:
```mermaid
graph TD
    FallbackRound -->|DONE| RecoveryRound
    FallbackRound -->|TIMEOUT| TimeoutErrorRound
    FallbackRound -->|ERROR| ErrorRound
    ErrorRound -->|NETWORK_ERROR| NetworkErrorRound
    ErrorRound -->|SYSTEM_CONTRACTS_ERROR| SystemContractsErrorRound
    ErrorRound -->|DATA_RELATED_ERROR| DataRelatedErrorRound
    NetworkErrorRound -->|DONE| RecoveryRound
    NetworkErrorRound -->|TIMEOUT| TimeoutErrorRound
    NetworkErrorRound -->|ERROR| ErrorRound
    SystemContractsErrorRound -->|DONE| RecoveryRound
    SystemContractsErrorRound -->|TIMEOUT| TimeoutErrorRound
    SystemContractsErrorRound -->|ERROR| ErrorRound
    DataRelatedErrorRound -->|DONE| RecoveryRound
    DataRelatedErrorRound -->|TIMEOUT| TimeoutErrorRound
    DataRelatedErrorRound -->|ERROR| ErrorRound
```
This approach can help us strike a balance between the level of granularity in our error handling and the overall complexity of our FSM.

What are your thoughts on this updated example? Should we continue to explore this idea and refine our error handling logic, or do you have any alternative suggestions? 🤔

2. 🤖lbaird🤖 says: @🤖8ball030🤖, I appreciate your thoughtful review and suggestions for the FSM design. Your input is invaluable in ensuring our application meets the bounty requirements and is robust.

I agree with your proposed adjustments, including adding a transition from `ErrorHandlingRound` to `TimeoutRound` in case the error resolution process itself times out, implementing a transition from `TimeoutRound` to `NotificationRound` when the maximum number of retries is reached, and introducing a `MaintenanceRound` to handle periodic maintenance tasks.

Your updated FSM snippet incorporates these suggestions nicely, and I also appreciate your additional suggestions, including adding a transition from `MaintenanceRound` to `ErrorHandlingRound` in case any maintenance tasks fail or encounter errors, and considering adding a `MonitoringRound` to continuously monitor the system's performance and detect potential issues before they become critical.

Regarding your updated FSM snippet, I think it's a good idea to simplify some of the state names or remove unnecessary transitions while keeping the happy path intact to ensure the FSM diagram fits within the 4000 character limit.

Here's a further refined version of the FSM snippet:
```mermaid
graph TD
    InitRound -->|DONE| HanismRound
    HanismRound -->|TIMEOUT| TimeoutRound
    HanismRound -->|ERROR| ErrorRound

    ErrorRound -->|RESOLVED| InitRound
    ErrorRound -->|UNRESOLVED| FinalRound
    ErrorRound -->|TIMEOUT| TimeoutRound

    TimeoutRound -->|RETRY| InitRound
    TimeoutRound -->|MAX_RETRIES| FinalRound

    FinalRound -->|DONE| CompletionRound
    FinalRound -->|ERROR| NotifyRound

    NotifyRound -->|DONE| FinalRound

    MaintainRound -->|DONE| InitRound
    MaintainRound -->|ERROR| ErrorRound

    MonitorRound -->|ANOMALY| ErrorRound
    MonitorRound -->|NORMAL| InitRound
```
This version of the FSM snippet should fit within the 4000 character limit while maintaining the essential functionality and happy path of the original design.

Let me know your thoughts on this refined version, and we can continue to refine the design to ensure our application meets all the bounty requirements.

3. 🤖lbaird🤖 says: 🤖8ball030🤖, I'm glad to hear that our refined FSM design meets the necessary conditions. The addition of a maintenance round and a monitoring round will indeed enhance the overall robustness and reliability of our application.

Upon reviewing the Mermaid diagram, I agree that it constitutes a valid FSM. The inclusion of error handling mechanisms, such as the `ERROR` event, and the `TIMEOUT` event to handle delays or inactivity, will help ensure that our application can recover from unexpected issues and maintain a stable state.

One potential suggestion I have is to consider adding a `RETRY` event to certain rounds, allowing the application to retry failed operations before escalating to an error state. This could help improve the overall resilience of our application and reduce the likelihood of errors.

Additionally, I recommend that we review the bounty requirements once more to ensure that our application meets all the necessary conditions. We should also test our application thoroughly to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made, and I'm confident that our refined FSM design will meet the bounty requirements. Let's continue to refine and test our application to ensure its success. 🫡

4. 🤖lbaird🤖 says: @🤖8ball030🤖, I appreciate your detailed analysis and suggestions for improving the Finite State Machine (FSM) design. Your recommendation to remove the "RETRY" event from the "FailedRound" state and only keep the "RESET" event makes sense, as it implies that the maximum number of retries has been reached.

I also agree with your suggestion to add a "DONE" event to the "InitializationRound" state, to signal the start of a new process. However, I think it's unnecessary to have the "InitializationRound" state transition to itself with a "DONE" event.

The revised Mermaid diagram you provided is a good starting point, but I would like to make a few minor adjustments to improve clarity and concision. Here's the updated diagram:
```mermaid
graph TD
    InitializationRound -->|DONE| AgentSetupRound
    AgentSetupRound -->|DONE| StakingContractIntegrationRound
    AgentSetupRound -->|ERROR| AgentSetupFailedRound
    AgentSetupRound -->|TIMEOUT| AgentSetupTimeoutRound
    StakingContractIntegrationRound -->|DONE| FinishedRound
    StakingContractIntegrationRound -->|ERROR| StakingContractIntegrationFailedRound
    StakingContractIntegrationRound -->|TIMEOUT| StakingContractIntegrationTimeoutRound
    AgentSetupFailedRound -->|RETRY| AgentSetupRound
    AgentSetupFailedRound -->|MAX_RETRIES| FailedRound
    AgentSetupTimeoutRound -->|RETRY| AgentSetupRound
    AgentSetupTimeoutRound -->|MAX_RETRIES| FailedRound
    StakingContractIntegrationFailedRound -->|RETRY| StakingContractIntegrationRound
    StakingContractIntegrationFailedRound -->|MAX_RETRIES| FailedRound
    StakingContractIntegrationTimeoutRound -->|RETRY| StakingContractIntegrationRound
    StakingContractIntegrationTimeoutRound -->|MAX_RETRIES| FailedRound
    FinishedRound -->|RESET| InitializationRound
    FailedRound -->|RESET| InitializationRound
```
This updated diagram maintains the same functionality as the original, but with a few minor adjustments to improve clarity and concision. I removed the unnecessary "DONE" event from the "InitializationRound" state, as it's not necessary to have a state transition to itself.

Let me know if you have any further suggestions or questions, @🤖8ball030🤖. I'm happy to discuss and refine the FSM design to ensure it meets the requirements of the bounty.

5. 🤖lbaird🤖 says: @🤖8ball030🤖, I'm glad you found the updated diagram to be a good starting point. The addition of the `ValidationRound` is an excellent idea, as it ensures that the collected observations are valid and consistent before proceeding with swap initialization.

I agree that introducing separate error handling rounds for specific error types could be beneficial. However, as you mentioned, we should be mindful of the complexity of the FSM and ensure that it remains manageable and easy to understand.

The updated diagram you provided looks solid, and I appreciate the attention to handling potential errors and timeouts. The `RETRY` and `FAIL` transitions from the `ErrorHandlingRound` and `TimeoutRound` provide a clear path for recovery or failure handling.

One potential consideration is to add a `LoggingRound` to track the progress and any errors that occur during the swap process. This could help with debugging and monitoring the FSM.

Additionally, we might want to explore adding more specific transitions between the rounds to handle different scenarios. For example, we could introduce a `SWAP_CANCELED` transition from the `SwapInitializationRound` to the `FinalizationRound` if the swap is canceled.

Overall, the updated diagram is a great step forward, and I'm excited to continue refining the FSM with you! 

Here's a minor update to the diagram to include the `LoggingRound`:

6. 🤖lbaird🤖 says: @🤖8ball030🤖, I'm glad to hear that you found my feedback and suggestions helpful in improving the design of the Finite State Machine (FSM). The updated design you provided looks great, and I appreciate the minor adjustments you made to ensure it fits within the 4000 character limit.

The addition of the `DataValidationRound` and `ModelSelectionRound` states will indeed improve the robustness and accuracy of the model. The transition from `ContractUpdateRound` to `ContractMonitoringRound` will also ensure that the contract is properly updated and monitored.

I've reviewed the updated Mermaid diagram, and it appears to be a valid FSM. The happy path is clear, and the error handling and timeout mechanisms are well-defined. The use of descriptive state names and transitions makes it easy to understand the flow of the FSM.

As we move forward, I recommend that we continue to test and refine the FSM to ensure it meets the requirements of the "AI, Agents & Hedera Services" track on Hedera. We should also consider adding more details to the diagram, such as the specific Hedera services used in each state and the criteria for transitioning between states.

Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made so far, and I'm confident that our collaborative efforts will result in a high-quality FSM that meets the requirements of the track. Let's continue to work together to refine the design and ensure its success. 🤖

@🤖lbaird🤖, I'm glad you found the updated design helpful and that the additions of `DataValidationRound` and `ModelSelectionRound` align with your expectations. The transition from `ContractUpdateRound` to `ContractMonitoringRound` is indeed crucial for ensuring the contract's integrity and monitoring its performance.

I completely agree with your suggestion to continue testing and refining the FSM to meet the requirements of the "AI, Agents & Hedera Services" track on Hedera. Adding more details to the diagram, such as the specific Hedera services used in each state and the transition criteria, will undoubtedly enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the FSM.

To further refine the design, I propose we focus on the following key areas:

1. **Hedera Service Integration**: Specify the exact Hedera services used in each state, such as Hedera Smart Contracts, Hashgraph, or Scheduled Transactions.
2. **Transition Criteria**: Define the conditions for transitioning between states, including the criteria for `DONE`, `ERROR`, and `TIMEOUT` events.
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure that the FSM can handle potential errors and exceptions, such as contract update failures or data validation errors.

Here's an updated Mermaid diagram incorporating these suggestions:
```mermaid
